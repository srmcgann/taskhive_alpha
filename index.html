		<span class="header12Texta">Taskhive neither<br>collects nor shares<br>your information.</span>
		<span class="header12Textb">Your job searches and work activity may seem<br>private to you, but companies such as Google<br>and Facebook are creating a treasure trove of<br>personal information by logging your online<br>activities, and making it potentially available<br>to any party wielding enough cash or a subpoena.</span>
		<span class="header12Textc">Third-parties cannot<br>lose that which<br>you don't give them.</span>
		<span class="header12Textd">The only solution<br>to retain privacy is to<br>start limiting what is<br>shared to begin with.</span>
		<span class="header12Texte">This personal identifying information and<br>website credentials are stored in databases,<br>which are then commonly hacked and<br>subsequently leaked by rogue government<br>agencies and for-profit blackhat hackers,<br>just like these:</span>

		<div class="logo8"></div>
		<span class="header13Texta">Privacy isn't for criminals.<br>It's for survival.</span>
		<span class="header13Textb">New technologies are radically advancing our freedoms,<br>but they are also enabling unparalleled invasions of privacy.<br><br>Society has yet to catch up with the evolving need for privacy<br>that comes with new digital technologies.<br><br>Over-sharing and trusting third-parties with indefinsible<br>amounts of personal information has become just another part<br>of a popular consumer model that simultaneously converts<br>patrons into trackable, controllable assets for whatever entity<br>happens to gain access.<br><br>Taskhive allows you to work in private; to choose how<br>much to share and with whom.</span>
